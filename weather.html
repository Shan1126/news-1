        <h3> Charlotte Weather</h3>
        <p> With most places outside of the mountains above the freezing mark, you’re probably seeing and hearing
            melting. Highs will be in the low 40s with mainly sunny skies.

            That is great during the day. Our luck runs out at night when temperatures fall back to the low 20s. That’s
            right! More black ice will be on the roads Tuesday morning. The rest of Tuesday will be uneventful with
            sunny skies and highs in the upper 40s.san antanio weather report</p>
